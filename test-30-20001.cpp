/*
Name: Longest Flight Route
Reference: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1680

Input: The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,\dots,n. City 1 is Syrj채l채, and city n is Lehm채l채.
After this, there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a flight from city a to city b. Each flight is a one-way flight.

Output: First print the maximum number of cities on the route. After this, print the cities in the order they will be visited. You can print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print "IMPOSSIBLE".
